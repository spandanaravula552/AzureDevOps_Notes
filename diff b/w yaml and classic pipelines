In Azure DevOps, both YAML pipelines and Classic editor pipelines are methods for defining and managing Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, but they differ significantly in their approach:
1. YAML Pipelines:
Definition:
YAML pipelines are defined as code using the YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) syntax within a .yml file, typically stored alongside your source code in a version control repository (e.g., Azure Repos Git, GitHub).
Version Control:
Being code, YAML pipelines benefit from version control features like branching, pull requests, and code reviews, allowing for easier tracking of changes and collaboration.
Automation:
They enable full automation of the CI/CD process, from building and testing to deployment, all defined within the YAML file.
Templates:
YAML supports the use of templates, promoting reusability and consistency across multiple pipelines.
Modern Approach:
YAML pipelines represent a more modern, "pipelines as code" approach to CI/CD, aligning with DevOps principles.
2. Classic Editor Pipelines:
Definition:
Classic editor pipelines are defined and managed through a graphical user interface (GUI) within the Azure DevOps web portal. You configure steps, tasks, and stages using visual editors and drag-and-drop functionalities.
Ease of Use:
They are generally considered more user-friendly for those less familiar with coding or YAML syntax, as they offer a visual representation of the pipeline flow.
Limited Versioning:
While the Classic Editor does offer some versioning capabilities, they are not as robust as those found in code-based YAML pipelines, making change tracking and collaboration potentially more challenging.
Deprecation:
Microsoft is actively prioritizing YAML pipelines for new features and updates, with the Classic Editor gradually being deprecated.
In summary:
YAML pipelines
offer a code-based, version-controlled, and highly automatable approach, ideal for modern DevOps practices and complex projects.
Classic Editor pipelines
provide a visual, GUI-driven method, easier for beginners but with limitations in versioning and future feature support. New projects are generally advised to use YAML pipelines.
