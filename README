# üí† AZURE DEVOPS INTERVIEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS (Complete Guide)

---

## üß© 1. Fundamentals of Azure DevOps

### 1. What is Azure DevOps?

**Answer:**
Azure DevOps is a cloud-based DevOps platform by Microsoft that provides development collaboration tools such as:

* **Azure Repos** ‚Äì Source code management (Git or TFVC).
* **Azure Pipelines** ‚Äì CI/CD for building, testing, and deploying code.
* **Azure Boards** ‚Äì Agile planning, work tracking, and Kanban boards.
* **Azure Test Plans** ‚Äì Manual and exploratory testing tools.
* **Azure Artifacts** ‚Äì Package management (NuGet, npm, Maven, Python).

---

### 2. Azure DevOps Services vs Azure DevOps Server

* **Azure DevOps Services:** Cloud-based, automatically updated, SaaS model.
* **Azure DevOps Server:** On-premises version; data stored locally; needs manual upgrades.

---

### 3. Benefits of Azure DevOps

* End-to-end DevOps toolchain.
* Integrates easily with Azure and other platforms.
* Scalable, secure, and customizable pipelines.
* Agile project management built in.

---

### 4. What is a DevOps pipeline?

A **pipeline** automates the build, test, and deployment of your application.
It can be defined via YAML or the classic UI.

---

### 5. What are CI and CD?

* **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automatically builds and tests code changes upon commit.
* **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Automatically deploys code to environments after passing CI.

---

### 6. What are ‚ÄúArtifacts‚Äù?

Artifacts are the **output** of build pipelines (e.g., compiled code, packages, Docker images) that can be used in release pipelines.

---

### 7. Build Pipeline vs Release Pipeline

| Feature | Build Pipeline  | Release Pipeline               |
| ------- | --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Purpose | Build/test code | Deploy code                    |
| Trigger | Code changes    | After build success            |
| Format  | YAML or classic | Classic UI or YAML multi-stage |
| Output  | Artifacts       | Deployments                    |

---

### 8. What is YAML in Azure DevOps?

**YAML (Yet Another Markup Language)** defines pipelines as code.
Example:

```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: 'build'
    projects: '**/*.csproj'
```

---

### 9. Integrate Azure Repos with GitHub

You can link Azure Pipelines to GitHub repos directly using **service connections** or **GitHub Apps**, enabling CI/CD from GitHub code.

---

### 10. What is a Service Connection?

A **service connection** allows Azure DevOps to authenticate to external services like Azure, AWS, DockerHub, or GitHub.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Intermediate: Pipelines & CI/CD

### 1. How to create a CI/CD pipeline?

* Navigate to **Pipelines ‚Üí New Pipeline**.
* Choose your repo (GitHub/Azure Repos).
* Define YAML or use the classic editor.
* Add build ‚Üí test ‚Üí deploy stages.

---

### 2. Multi-Stage vs Classic Pipelines

* **Multi-stage YAML:** Build, test, and deploy defined in one file (pipeline-as-code).
* **Classic:** UI-based, split between build and release.

---

### 3. How can you trigger a pipeline?

* Automatically (on commit, pull request, or schedule).
* Manually (via ‚ÄúRun pipeline‚Äù).
* From another pipeline (via pipeline resources).

---

### 4. What are pipeline variables?

Used to store configuration data (environment names, credentials, paths).

```yaml
variables:
  buildConfig: 'Release'
steps:
- script: echo $(buildConfig)
```

---

### 5. What are Environments?

Logical groupings of deployment targets (e.g., Dev, QA, Prod).
Support approvals, gates, and deployment tracking.

---

### 6. Pipeline Templates

You can reuse pipeline logic across projects.

```yaml
# main pipeline
extends:
  template: templates/build.yml
```

---

### 7. Managing Secrets

Use **Variable Groups** (linked to Key Vault) or pipeline variables marked as secret.

---

### 8. Pipeline Agents

* **Microsoft-hosted:** Provided and managed by Microsoft.
* **Self-hosted:** Installed on your own VM/server.

---

### 9. Artifact Retention

Controls how long build artifacts are stored (default 30 days). Helps manage storage and compliance.

---

### 10. Deploy to Azure App Service

Use the **Azure WebApp task**:

```yaml
- task: AzureWebApp@1
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: 'ServiceConnection'
    appName: 'mywebapp'
    package: '$(System.ArtifactsDirectory)/drop/*.zip'
```

---

## üîÄ 3. Azure Repos & Boards

### 1. What are Azure Repos?

Source control repositories supporting **Git** or **TFVC**.

---

### 2. Branching & Merging

Common strategy: **GitFlow**

* `main` ‚Üí production-ready code
* `develop` ‚Üí integration
* `feature/*`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*`

---

### 3. Pull Request Policies

Set branch policies to require reviews, builds, and work item linking before merging.

---

### 4. Git vs TFVC

| Feature      | Git         | TFVC        |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| Model        | Distributed | Centralized |
| Branching    | Lightweight | Heavy       |
| Offline work | Yes         | No          |

---

### 5. Azure Boards

Provides Agile planning tools: **Epics, Features, User Stories, Tasks, Bugs**.
Supports Scrum and Kanban boards.

---

## üîê 4. Advanced: Automation, Security, Monitoring

### 1. Integration with Jenkins/SonarQube/Terraform

* **Jenkins:** Trigger via REST API or Azure DevOps plugin.
* **SonarQube:** Add SonarQubePrepare ‚Üí RunAnalysis ‚Üí PublishQualityGate tasks.
* **Terraform:** Use AzureCLI or Terraform tasks in pipelines.

---

### 2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Use **Terraform** or **ARM/Bicep** templates in Azure DevOps pipelines:

```yaml
- task: TerraformCLI@0
  inputs:
    command: 'apply'
```

---

### 3. Blue-Green & Canary Deployments

Deploy new versions alongside the old one (blue-green) or to a subset of users (canary). Managed via **deployment slots** or **environments with approvals**.

---

### 4. Rollback Strategy

* Keep previous successful build artifact.
* Use deployment slots to swap back quickly.

---

### 5. Managing Multiple Environments

Use **stages** and **environment variables**:

```yaml
stages:
- stage: Dev
  ...
- stage: Prod
  dependsOn: Dev
```

---

### 6. Security & RBAC

Azure DevOps supports role-based access:

* **Project-level roles:** Reader, Contributor, Administrator.
* **Fine-grained policies:** Repo permissions, environment approvals.

---

### 7. Azure Key Vault Integration

Store secrets in Key Vault and link to variable groups.

---

### 8. Auditing

Enable **Auditing** under Organization settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Audit logs.

---

### 9. Monitoring Pipelines

* View pipeline duration & logs.
* Use Application Insights for deployed apps.

---

### 10. Automated Testing

Integrate test tasks in pipelines:

```yaml
- task: VSTest@2
  inputs:
    testSelector: 'testAssemblies'
```

---

## üß† 5. Scenario-Based Answers

| Scenario                             | Approach                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deployment failed**                | Check pipeline logs, variables, agent logs, permissions.  |
| **Secret rotation**                  | Store secrets in Azure Key Vault, re-link automatically.  |
| **Pipeline only after test success** | Use stages with `dependsOn` and `condition: succeeded()`. |
| **Prod approvals**                   | Add approval gates in Environment settings.               |
| **Multi-repo project**               | Use pipeline triggers and repository resources.           |
