In Azure DevOps, agents are the computing infrastructure used to run jobs in pipelines. There are two main types: Microsoft-hosted agents and self-hosted agents, each with distinct characteristics: 
Microsoft-Hosted Agents: 

• Management: Fully managed by Microsoft. Users select an agent image (e.g., Windows, Ubuntu) and Microsoft handles the underlying infrastructure, updates, and maintenance. 
• Isolation: Each pipeline run gets a fresh, isolated virtual machine, ensuring a clean environment and preventing conflicts from previous runs. 
• Simplicity: Easier to set up and use, especially for common build and deployment scenarios, as no infrastructure management is required. 
• Cost: Included in Azure DevOps usage, with certain limitations on free tier usage (e.g., job timeout limits). 

Self-Hosted Agents: 

• Management: Users are responsible for providing, configuring, and maintaining the agent infrastructure (e.g., virtual machines, physical servers, or containers). 
• Control and Customization: Offers greater control over the environment, allowing installation of specific software, tools, and configurations required for unique build or deployment needs. 
• Performance and Caching: Machine-level caches and configurations can persist between runs, potentially leading to faster incremental builds and improved performance for specific workloads. 
• Cost: Users incur the cost of the underlying infrastructure where the agent is hosted. 
• Flexibility: Can be deployed in various environments, including on-premises data centers, private clouds, or other public cloud providers, enabling hybrid scenarios. 

Key Differences Summarized: 

| Feature | Microsoft-Hosted Agents | Self-Hosted Agents  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Management | Managed by Microsoft | Managed by User  |
| Environment | Clean VM per run | Persistent environment  |
| Customization | Limited (predefined images) | High (user-controlled)  |
| Infrastructure Cost | Included in Azure DevOps usage | User-incurred  |
| Use Case | Common builds/deployments | Specific software, performance, hybrid scenarios  |
